These are the lecture slides from my recent "Deep Learning for Actuaries" courses (coded ACTL3143 & ACTL5111) at UNSW.


This repository can be used to see:

1. what topics I covered in these courses,
2. an example for making [UNSW-themed reveal.js slides with Quarto](https://github.com/Pat-Laub/UNSW-Quarto-Slides-Template).

These slides are not intended to be used to learn deep learning from scratch.
For that, you need to attend the lectures & complete the assessment.

::: {.callout-note}
Most lectures start with a 'preamble' of feedback & admin things that are probably not too interesting for a general audience; press 'o' to go to toggle the overview mode, and use the arrow keys to quickly skip past these to the main content.
E.g., I would recommend starting at [this slide in Lecture 2](Lecture-2-Deep-Learning-Keras/deep-learning-keras.html#/machine-learning); Lecture 1 was mainly an introduction to the course and to the Python language.

Some of the figures in these slides are blurred out. That is because their copyright allows for the use within classes, but not for general reproduction/publication, so I have redacted the relevant figures here.
