# Overview

These are the lecture slides from my recent "Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Models for Actuarial Applications" courses (coded ACTL3143 & ACTL5111) at UNSW.
They can be used to see what topics I covered in these courses.
The slides are not intended to be used to learn deep learning from scratch.
For that, you need to attend the lectures & complete the assessment.

# Readings

The readings from the book will come mainly from @geron2022hands, which is available through the UNSW Library's access to O'Reilly Media texts.
I'll give references to the 3rd edition, but if you get your hands on a copy of the 2nd edition then that is also fine.
Some readings will be from @james2021statistical (or equivalently the the Python version @james2023statistical) which is [available online](https://www.statlearning.com).
Note, if I say "read from A up to B", that means to read A but stop at B (without reading it).

| Week | Readings |
|:-:|--------------|
| 1 | @geron2022hands: Chapter 1, Chapter 2 (up to "Handling Text and Categorical Attributes"), @james2021statistical: Sections 10.1 & 10.2
| 2 | @geron2022hands: Chapter 2 (up to "Launch, Monitor, and Maintain Your System"), Chapter 3 (up to "Multilabel Classification"), Chapter 10 ("Implementing MLPs with Keras" up to "Building Complex Models Using the Functional API")
| 3 | @james2021statistical: Section 10.3, @geron2022hands: Chapter 14 (just skim through the specific historical architectures, like InceptionNet etc.) |
| 4 | @james2021statistical: Section 10.4, @vajjala2020practical: Chapters 1 and 2 (up to "Modeling") |
| 5 | @james2021statistical: Section 10.5, @geron2022hands: Chapter 15 |
| 7 | - |
| 8 | - |
| 9 | @chollet2021deep: Chapter 12 |
| 10 | - |

The following readings are for those who are taking ACTL3142/ACTL5110 at the same time as ACTL3143/ACTL5111 (or who just need to brush up on that course a little):

| Week | Readings (ACTL3142 Revision) |
|:--:|--------------|
| 1 | @james2021statistical: Chapter 2, Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 5.1.1 |
| 2 | @james2021statistical: Section 3.3.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 |
