These are the lecture slides from my recent "Deep Learning for Actuaries" courses (coded ACTL3143 & ACTL5111) at UNSW.

If you already know a bit of Python syntax, I recommend to start at [this slide in Lecture 2](Lecture-2-Deep-Learning-Keras/deep-learning-keras.html#/machine-learning), as Lecture 1 was mainly an introduction to the course and to the Python language.

This repository can be used as an example for making reveal.js slides using Quarto.
A more basic template for creating Quarto slides with this theme is at the [UNSW-Quarto-Slides-Template repository](https://github.com/Pat-Laub/UNSW-Quarto-Slides-Template).

Some of the figures are blurred out. That is because their copyright allows for the use within classes, but not for general reproduction/publication, so I have redacted the relevant figures here.
